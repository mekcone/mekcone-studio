# The ExCRUD DevOps Tool
by *Tenton Lien*

## What is ExCRUD?

ExCRUD is a dev-ops tool which supports generating codes and managing server hosts and databases. It can partly help you reduce some robotic work, especially CRUD operations in web service projects.

### ExCRUD Code-Gen

The code-gen tool uses existing templates to generate codes and documents for web services. You just need to write an XML file after reading this document and execute the tool to complete a lot of work automatically. If you are not willing to write an XML file manually, you can use the web app as a GUI tool.

So far, ExCRUD can help you generate Spring Boot back-ends, enterprise official websites, API documents, etc.
